So we thought that we need to stop that. Everyone of us loves coding and being creative, so the idea of a CSS framework was born. We are sure that you are now thinking “Mhm but there are already so many frameworks and they are all the same”. Yes, you are right but we are different. We are aware of the different frameworks like bootstrap, materialize… . However, the major difference that makes us unique and special is that we provide a detailed documentation about our code, problems and tips to avoid difficulties. ",

So you don’t have to worry because we can help you easily. Our code is very well explained and easy to understand. So when you struggle just have a quick look to our documentation.

The only problem was there were so many different and complicated clarifications. So we will make this as easy as possible for you. Just imagine when you are for example on facebook on your laptop. But when you open facebook on other devices like iPad, iPhone or television. You will notice that the website looks different on each device. How does this work? The words what are you looking for are called Responsive Design. Basically, responsive design is made for usability based on appropriate screen resolution for each device. Without responsive design your website will totally look varios on your mobile device as on your laptop.",

So we are aware of that our code has to be as easy as possible. Furthermore, our framework is ideal for everyone. It doesn’t matter if you want to start a blog or business. With our framework you are on the best way to succeed. Why? Because everyone who starts a blog for example takes wordpress to design their website. To be honest it’s nice but when you see only websites with wordpress after time you will get bored. Try something cool! Start with CreativePuzzle and impress your competitive!

    content: "SASS is an extension to the common CSS. The greatest expansion is variables, if you are more professional coder your stylesheets will grow very huge if you have to write everything over and over again. Sass will help you to shorten and simplify your stylesheet with variables, importing stuff, color functions, mixin and even more extensions. You can easily declare variables so you won’t forget your header color for example. The Sass “@Import function” is way more efficient than the CSS one. CSS will do another HTTP request whereas SASS imports it before it compiles.",

As mentioned before you are able to change object in the DOM, it’s also called manipulation of the DOM.  </li></li> <li> CSS <li>The Cascading Style Sheet brings colors, borders and design to you webpage. You are able to style objects, which are loaded into the Document Object Model. The latest version is CSS3, which brings a bunch of new options like animations, flexboxes and element selectors. After learning HTML at least you have to learn how to code a Cascading Style Sheet to give your page a basic design. Furthermore, you are able to use preprocessor languages, which are compiled to common CSS. With these you are able to use features like variables, loops or mixin’s.

The point of matter is to give the div you want to be an image a CSS class and add the picturepath as background-image. Afterwards you have to write the command background-attachment: fixed. That's all the magic. You can modify the layout by setting the background-position for example to left center.",
