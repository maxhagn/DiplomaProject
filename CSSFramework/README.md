# Diploma Project CSS Framework

In the scope of our diploma thesis we wrote a CSS framework that allows beginners in web development to easily assemble their own web pages. The framework contains styles for the most important HTML elements. Components such as navigation bars, images, grid systems and others are also available. Furthermore, ready-made templates for websites can be downloaded.

The framework is still available at [https://css-framework.hagn.network](https://css-framework.hagn.network).
