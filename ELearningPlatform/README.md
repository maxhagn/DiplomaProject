# Diploma Project E-Learning Platform

The main goal of our diploma thesis at the higher technical school Rennweg was to develop an e-learning platform that makes it easier for students of our school to learn the basic principles of web development. For this purpose we developed a web application based on a level system that assigns different tasks to the user. The user can solve the task directly in our system and see the result of the code live.
